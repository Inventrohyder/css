  <h1> Kenya Affordable housing</h1>
  <p> Kenya identifies affordable housing as a top priority with a goal of adding 500,000 homes in the next five years. As an aspiring <b> civil engineer</b> , I consi\
der this a mission I could have an impact in given the exponential growth of slums in the past decade.</p>

  <h2> The trend</h2>
  <p>Kenya is a <b>populous</b> and growing country with close to <b> 50 million</b> people. As the economy continues to expand, more Kenyans are leaving rural regions\
 for more urban areas in search for higher paying careers. This move has created a huge demand for additional housing in cities such as Nairobi, Mombasa, and Eldoret a\
mong others.</p>

  <p> Recognizing this need, the Government of Kenya identified Affordable Housing as one of our top four priorities, building houses across the metropolitan cities, t\
he end goal being additional 500,000 homes over the next five years.</p>

  <h3> My mission </h3>
  <p>
  The truth is that <b> not </b> every Kenyan citizen would have access to these houses.Nevertheless, the portion to be accommodated is very small as compared to the r\
ising population. This is the right time to plan expeditiously. I believe that the larger population, especially the youth, should first be educated on the importance \
of saving. The saving culture has been done away with, thus the upcoming population find themselves in slums simply because the did not plan proir. This is integral to\
 my vision as buildings are expensive to setup and maintain. Materials have to be purchased, workers need to be paid... you know what I mean. This can be executed by s\
etting up a sacco, so that those who share in this vision can have a direct agenda.</p>

<p>
  Technology is <b>powerful</b> in all spheres of life. A majority of computers today are automated, requiring no human input.Moreover, the recent invention of Tesla's\
 electric autonomous cars has proven that anything is possible; epitomizing a probable revolution in the car industry. The next decade could see a significant increase\
 in purchase and use of electric cars since they are cheaper to maintain. This highlights how Tesla single-handedly transformed the car industry through technology- sp\
ecifically <b>machine learning</b>.
</p>

  <p> In the same vein, I believe the same could be done to the housing industry. With appropriate plans and achievable goals, we could get rid of slums and poor housi\
ng structures via an integral approach in <b>software</b> and <b>mass education</b>. This is my vision. Come aboard, let us sail through.
